- To understand why existing functionality doesn't support their business needs


## Roles

## Entry Criteria

T2.		Refine: **Customer** refines the requirements document based on feedback (the **Project Manager** may need to assist in this).

T3.		Publish: When both parties are happy with the requirements the **Project Manager** shares the requirements on the JIRA ticket and moves the ticket into the ballpark queue

		

## Verification
Full verification of requiremets happens at the [ballpark][2] step

## Exit Criteria
- Requirements document is complete
- **Project Manager** fully understands the **Customer**'s requirement (to be able to present it to the business)

## Deliverables
